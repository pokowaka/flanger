Is an AngularJS, Bootstrap based web frontend for Kodi (XBMC) inspired by the Zune & Chorus interface. It is basically a project for me to learn more about JavaScript, Bootstrap & AngularJS.

To get you started in a development environment:

* Get [corsproxy](https://github.com/gr2m/CORS-Proxy), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and [bower](http://bower.io/)
* Edit app.js and modify the variable baseurl to pass through corsproxy to your Kodi instance. Make sure you bind the proxy to all networks (i.e. corsproxy 0.0.0.0) so that you can access the site with other devices on your local network. 

`npm install`

`bower install`
 
`corsproxy 0.0.0.0`
 
`grunt serve`

And hack away!
